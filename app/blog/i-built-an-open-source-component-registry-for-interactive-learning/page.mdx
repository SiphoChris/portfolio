# I Built an Open-Source Component Registry for Interactive Learning — Here's Why

I've been looking into building an edtech project, and before touching the product itself, I wanted to build the primitives that would support it. When I explored the ecosystem for interactive learning components — quizzes, flashcards, spaced repetition, drag-and-drop exercises — I noticed something: these are components with very similar behaviour, just different data. Yet every team rebuilds them from scratch.

That felt like a gap worth closing. I wanted to give something back to the ecosystem that has given me everything I know about this craft, and remove the friction of rebuilding the same primitives over and over with no shared foundation. So I built one.

## What is lmscn?

lmscn is an open-source registry of production-ready interactive learning components built on shadcn/ui and Tailwind v4. You install them the same way you install any shadcn component — you own the code completely and can wire them into whatever backend or LMS logic you already have.

The registry includes ten components:

- **Quiz** — single, multiple-choice, and true/false questions with scoring and pass/fail thresholds
- **Flashcards** — 3D flip-cards with self-rating (Again / Hard / Good / Easy)
- **Match** — click-to-match term and definition pairs with mistake tracking
- **Fill in the Blank** — inline cloze exercises with multi-blank and alternative answer support
- **Scramble** — letter-tile word unscrambling with image and text clues
- **Order** — drag-and-drop or keyboard item sequencing
- **Reading Passage** — reading comprehension across three phases: read, answer, review
- **Progress Tracker** — gamified XP lesson map with streaks, levels, and unit progress
- **Spaced Repetition** — SM-2 algorithm review sessions with computed next intervals
- **Hotspot** — click markers on diagrams and type labels into popovers

Each component is fully typed, accepts a single data prop, and fires an `onComplete` callback — so your application owns the logic, and the component handles the interaction.

## Why Build It at All?

The options I found were either a heavyweight LMS platform that owned everything and let you customise nothing, or starting from zero and rebuilding patterns I'd already built before. There was no composable middle ground — components you could install, read, and modify freely.

Beyond the practical gap, I wanted to contribute to the open-source ecosystem. shadcn/ui, Tailwind, and the broader React community have shaped how I think about building software. lmscn is my attempt to put something useful back.

## The Unexpected Lesson

Building it taught me something I didn't expect: the hard part of learning software isn't the feature list — it's the feel.

The moment a flashcard flips. The way feedback lands after a wrong answer. The difference between a component that technically works and one a student actually wants to engage with. These details live in small decisions — animation timing, colour on error states, focus management — and they are what make a learner stay or leave.

They deserve the same engineering attention as any other part of a product. lmscn is my attempt to give those details a solid, reusable foundation so that other teams don't have to figure them out from scratch under pressure.

## Get Started

Install any component the same way you would any shadcn primitive:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://lmscn.vercel.app/r/quiz.json
```

The docs cover every component's props, data shape, and result types in full.
